## Contributing

Contributions to the mmeddle.js workspace library are very welcome! We can't do this alone.
You can contribute in different ways: spread the word, report bugs, come up with
ideas and suggestions, and contribute to the code.

There are a few preferences regarding code contributions:

- mmeddle.js [mostly] follows the node.js code style as described
  [here](https://github.com/felixge/node-style-guide).
- Violate code style when there is a good reason, not because you feel like it.
- Send pull requests to the `develop` branch, not the `master` branch.
- Only commit changes to source files under `src` and `test`, not to builds
  located in `dist`.

Thanks!  JF

#** NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME **

When the branches are ready for actual developers, I'll remove this message.
For the next few months this project is closed to external developers.
Please stand by.
