/* 
    mMeddle Configuration file.

    Configuration files are used to populate the mm.config object.
    The '[name].config.json' files are read once during startup. 
    The root directory is checked first and if no config is found,
    the ./config subdirectory is examined for the same file. 
    This lets you override a ./config file by copying it to the root
    and changing it to your hearts content.

    If any [name].config.json file contains a 'debug: true' directive, or if 
    either environment variable DEBUG=true, or MMEDDLE_DEBUG=true then
    [name].debug.config.json files are also processed. These can override
    any settings of the prior config file.

    For a typical application the .config files read are:

        mmeddle.config.json
        [appname].config.json

    As an example, for the 'server' application, when DEBUG=true,
    the files read are:

        mmeddle.config.json
        mmeddle.debug.config.json
        server.config.json
        server.debug.config.json
